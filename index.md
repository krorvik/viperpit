This is the build log, or full description - or whatever you like to call it, of my Viper Simpit built for DCS World.

At the moment, work is still in progress, but I'm keeping this page updated every once in a while. Currently, most inputs are functional, and I am working on outputs. The pit itself is almost ready, and some details are still under work.
