The computer interfacing is a topic of it's own. This is my setup as it stands:

* ASUS ROG Strix B450-F GAMING II motherboard
* AMD Ryzen 2700x
* 32 GB 3200MHz RAM
* 1.5TB SSD on NVMe
* RTX 3080, 3xDP, 1xHDMI - main display
* RTX 3070, 2xHDMI, 2xDP, MFDs, EHSI, RWR
* Samsung 65" 4k curved TV, main display
* 750W PSU
* Windows 10

MFDs are both run via DP to HDMI active cables. RWR and EHSI is run on HDMI directly.

Three USB hubs are set up, all 13 ports. They are carefully placed in the mainboards ports to avoid device conflicts - this was a bit work to get right.
