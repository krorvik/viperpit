The seat is a standard [Playseat Evolution Black](https://www.playseatstore.com/evolution-black.html), where I used just the seat frame and seat itself. The sliding rails are in use and give some flexibility for larger pilots. Nothing magic here, fastened with four bolts through the base. The forward bolts are right ahead of the corner in the floor, and supported by a small support where the base protrudes (about 5cm).
