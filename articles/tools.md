For any engineer, tooling matters. A lot. My Dremel, miniature circular saw and a stepped drill bit had gotten me a long way,   the precision was a bit lacking. And the knobs were standardized ebay items. Not quite good for realism.

# Laser cutting acrylics

Late fall 2020, I gained access to a 40W CO2 laser cutter with a sufficient cutting area to cut parts around 30x20cm. This is also a very good tool for engraving, and with a little bit of clever work, you can cut and etch panels from acrylic glass that look really good. More on that later.

Laser cutting is a complex subject all by itself, and comes with a fair bit of surrounding stuff (ventilation, watercooling, air assist) but with a little bit of practice, some nice panels came out. I recommend taking a look at [k40.se](https://k40.se/) for more information. If you plan on getting one, have some space available - there's more than the machine itself.

And a stern warning: *ONLY CUT SAFE MATERIALS WITH LASER* - other plastic materials might ruin both your health and the laser cutter if you try jamming laser through it. See https://lasergods.com/co2-laser-engraver-safety/ for more information.

The laser cutter I use is one with an analog amperemeter for power, which makes it easy to tune the right power. For my cuts in 3mm opal white acrylic and 2mm clear acrylic, I cut at 17mA, 6mm/s, and for the styrene engraved at 7mA, 200mm/s. Any less current would not trigger the laser.  Beware that you need to experiment to find the settings to use, depending on laser power and ratings, focus, materials and other variables. I only cut at (water) temperatures 15-20C, and used air assist for all work. Focus is important for text clarity when engraving, and as always, make sure the laser is aligned for precision and cut quality.

I used [k40whisperer](https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html) for all laser work. There are also a lot of videos on Youtube for laser cutting. Do spend some time on the safety related ones.

# 3D-printing

For christmas in 2020, my wife gave me an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer) 3d-printer. This is perfect for making the knobs needed. I have an airbrush and compressor for modelling already, and with these the knobs can be painted in the right colors with ease.

The 3d-printer, even with a relatively small print volume (23.5 x 23.5 x 25cm), can also help print other parts for the cockpit. In fact, I used it to print much of the center console broken down into small enough sections.

These are excellent tools to make panels, and print other needed parts for a cockpit. So I started the journey to a new and improved pit.
