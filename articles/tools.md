For any engineer, tooling matters. A lot. My Dremel, miniature circular saw and a stepped drill bit had gotten me a long way,   the precision was a bit lacking. And the knobs were standardized ebay items. Not quite good for realism.

Late fall 2020, I gained access to a 40W  laser cutter with a sufficient cutting area to cut parts around 30x20cm. This is also a very good tool for engraving, and with a little bit of clever work, you can cut and etch panels from acrylic glass that look really good. More on that later.

Laser cutting is a complex subject all by itself, and comes with a fair bit of surrounding stuff (ventilation, watercooling, air assist) but with a little bit of practice, some nice panels came out. I recommend taking a look at [k40.se](https://k40.se/) for more information. If you plan on getting one, have some space available - there's more than the machine itself.

For christmas in 2020, my wife gave me an [Ender 3](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer) 3d-printer. This is perfect for making the knobs needed. I have an airbrush and compressor for modelling already, and with these the knobs can be painted in the right colors with ease.

The 3d-printer, even with a relatively small print volume (23.5 x 23.5 x 25cm), can also help print other parts for the cockpit. In fact, I used it to print much of the center console broken down into small enough sections.

These are excellent tools to make panels, and print other needed parts for a cockpit. So I started the journey to a new and improved pit.
