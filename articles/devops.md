[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) in computer science is the art of developing software with continuous improvement, and making small, controlled changes as you go. It is in my nature to keep going. At this point, a few weaknesses were apparent:

* Cable spaghetti - a lot of dupont wiring and USB cables.
* Moving sidestick
* Center console not quite well shaped
* No instruments or lights (outputs) - only inputs
* Not really a good representation of panels (only crude positioning)
* Joystick where right aux panel should be
* Throttle a bit lacking
