[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) in computer science is the art of developing software with continuous improvement, and making small, controlled changes as you go. I've worked this way for many years, and the methods we use are very much applicable to other subjects.

It is in my nature to keep going. At this point, a few weaknesses were apparent:

* Cable spaghetti - a lot of dupont wiring and USB cables.
* Moving sidestick
* Center console not quite well shaped
* No instruments or lights (outputs) - only inputs - still need to see rendered pit for info
* Not really a good representation of panels (only crude positioning)
* Stick where right aux panel should be
* Throttle still a bit lacking, and not quite precise

This, of course, is a perfect reason to spend another year (?) at the workbench, improving the pit.
