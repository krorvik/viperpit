There are a few places where I resorted to off-the-shelf hardware, due to complexity. These are:

* Real Simulator [FSSB R3 lighting](https://realsimulator.com/fssb-r3-lighting/) force feedaback sidestick base
* Real Simulator [F16SGRH](https://realsimulator.com/f-16-side-grips/) sidestick
* Thrustmaster [Cougar MFD](http://www.thrustmaster.com/products/mfd-cougar-pack) controllers
* Simgears [F-16 ICP](https://www.simgears.com/simgears-products/f16-icp-replica/)
* Thrustmaster [Pendular rudder pedals](http://www.thrustmaster.com/en_US/products/tpr-thrustmaster-pendular-rudder)

The ICP and MFD installations are covered in the [pit construction page](/viperpit/articles/pit.html). The rudder is simply bolted on at the end of the floor. All use USB connections.

# Mounting the base and stick

The base and stick are mounted at the front left of the right main console. A 3d-printed base extender gives it a good height. Note that the image is old, an additional extender is mounted between the printed base and the FSSB R3 in the image now, for better ergonomics.
