There are a few places where I resorted to off-the-shelf hardware, due to complexity. These are:

* Real Simulator [FSSB R3 lighting](https://realsimulator.com/fssb-r3-lighting/) force feedaback sidestick base
* Real Simulator [F16SGRH](https://realsimulator.com/f-16-side-grips/) sidestick
* Thrustmaster [Cougar MFD](http://www.thrustmaster.com/products/mfd-cougar-pack) controllers
* Simgears [F-16 ICP](https://www.simgears.com/simgears-products/f16-icp-replica/)
* Thrustmaster [Pendular rudder pedals](http://www.thrustmaster.com/en_US/products/tpr-thrustmaster-pendular-rudder)
