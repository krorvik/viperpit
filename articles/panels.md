With the laser cutter, all the panels were up for a remake. The design of the panels were made using a couple of open source programs: [LibreCAD](https://librecad.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). The former for 2D plans for the cutter in DXF format, and the latter for making engraving files in SVG format. The F-16 panels use a font called [MS33558](https://www.wfonts.com/font/ms-33558), which I used for the engraving.

Laser cutting is a whole subject by itself. I cut the panels from (mostly) 3 layers, a bottom 3mm opal white acrylic that holds the hardware, then a new opal white 3mm layer that acts as a diffuser, as well as a distance for the hardware nuts and other fixings. Above that, a 1mm white styrene sheet that acts as a cover. This layer is glued to the middle layer, then painted black and engraved with the laser cutter for white text - which will be green when backlit. The rear layer has green LED strips attached to create the backlight. CAD files are available to create these in the cad/panels/* folders.

The dimensions for the panels are available at [hispapanels](https://hispapanels.com/tienda/en/20-f-16-fighting-falcon), where you can also buy them if you don't have access to a laser cutter. "Slightly" more expensive though. Hispapanels obviously don't give you the CAD files of course.
