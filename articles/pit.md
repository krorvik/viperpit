# Base framess

 Construction is done using 23x30mm wood cut using a precise table saw. I'd advise against manual cuts.

 The panels do not go directly to these frames, instead the base frames are sized to fit separate panel mounting frames for each console. There are five base frames:

* Right console - front and back in one part
* Right auxiliary console
* Left auxiliary console, mirroring the right one
* Left front part of main console, with room for separate throttle mount on outer side
* Left aft part of main console, a little wider

For the left and right main consoles, the frame is angled 7 degress towards the seat. The right one is a bit shorter than the right ones - I opted not to make room for the DLT/stowage part.

# Floor

The floor is a separate part, with the pedal mount protruding in front of the center console position, and the seat part sloping down towards the back to support an angled seat (The actual F-16 ACES-II seat back is reclined 30 degrees).

# Screen mount

In front of the center console, a more solid frame built from 48x98mm wood is placed to support a large TV screen
