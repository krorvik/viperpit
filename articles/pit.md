The pit itself was rebuilt, this time with a more correct overall shape (although not precise).

The panels are not mounted directly to the pit, but on separate panel mounting frames that attach to the pit.

The pit frame itself is divided into sections - the rear left console, front left console, left auxiliary console, right auxiliary console, and right console (not split). For the left and right side consoles, the frame is angled 7 degress towards the seat. Construction is done using 23x30mm wood cut using a precise table saw. I'd advise against manual cuts.

The floor is a separate part, with the pedal part protruding in front of the center console position, and the seat part sloping down towards the back to support an angled seat (The actual F-16 ACES-II seat back is reclined 30 degrees).

In front of the center console, a more solid frame built from 48c98mm wood is placed to support a large TV screen.
