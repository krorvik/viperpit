# Base frames

 Construction is done using 23x30mm wood cut using a precise table saw. I'd advise against manual cuts.

 The panels do not go directly to these frames, instead the base frames are sized to fit separate panel mounting frames for each console. There are five base frames:

* Right console - front and back in one part
* Right auxiliary console
* Left auxiliary console, mirroring the right one
* Left front part of main console, with room for separate throttle mount on outer side
* Left aft part of main console, a little wider

For the left and right main consoles, the frame is angled 7 degress towards the seat. The right one is a bit shorter than the right ones - I opted not to make room for the DLT/stowage part.

# Panel frames

The frames for the panels establish the upwards angle of the front part of the consoles, and consist of 3D-printed supports and 10x20mm pine to screw the panels in place.

The following panel frames are used:

* Right rearmost console - avi power, antenna/icing
* Right rear console - Oxygen, KY58
* Right front - Sensor power, hud, int lights and aircond
* Right front behind stick - seat (custom location), betty
* Left front inner UHF, audio, ECM, recorder
* Left front outer - Engine, elec
* Left rear 1 - fuel, iff, ext lights
* Left rear 2 - flcs, trim
* Left rearmost - test

The following image shows how these look:

# Floor

The floor is a separate part, with the pedal mount protruding in front of the center console position, and the seat part sloping down towards the back to support an angled seat (The actual F-16 ACES-II seat back is reclined 30 degrees).

# Screen mount

In front of the center console, a more solid frame built from 48x98mm wood is placed to support a large TV screen
