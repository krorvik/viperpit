Construction is done using 23x48mm wood cut using a precise table saw. I'd advise against manual cuts.

TODO: DXF files are available showing the design of all the base frames.

# Base frames

The panels do not go directly to these frames, instead the base frames are sized to fit separate panel mounting frames for each console. There are five base frames:

* Right console - front and back in one part
* Right auxiliary console
* Left auxiliary console, mirroring the right one
* Left front part of main console, with room for separate throttle mount on outer side
* Left aft part of main console, a little wider

For the left and right main consoles, the frame is angled 7 degress towards the seat. The right one is a bit shorter than the right ones - I opted not to make room for the DLT/stowage part.

# Panel frames

The frames for the panels establish the upwards angle of the front part of the consoles, and consist of 3D-printed supports and 10x20mm pine along the edges to screw the panels in place.

The following panel frames are used:

* Right rearmost console - avi power, antenna/icing
* Right rear console - Oxygen, KY58
* Right front - Sensor power, hud, int lights and aircond
* Right front behind stick - seat (custom location), betty
* Left front inner UHF, audio, ECM, recorder
* Left front outer - Engine, elec
* Left rear 1 - fuel, iff, ext lights
* Left rear 2 - flcs, trim
* Left rearmost - test

# Floor

The floor is a separate part, with the pedal mount protruding in front of the center console position, and the seat part sloping down towards the back to support an angled seat (The actual F-16 ACES-II seat back is reclined 30 degrees). The frame for the floor is built from 23x48mm like the others, except the vertical parts are 3D-printed. Yeah, I ran out of wood...

The width of the floor corresponds to the width of the center console (instrument panel), and also matches that of the seat.

# Putting the baseÂ frames together

First, I attached all the left consoles and all the right consoles together, so that the inner wall is flush. I then attached the floor section to the sides so that the floorslope starts where the side consoles meets the auxiliary consoles (see top image).

Next, the floor got a 16mm plywood covering, followed by 4mm birch plywood in the floor and inner sides of the pit.

# Auxiliary consoles panel

The auxiliary consoles are a 4mm plywood panel that is supported by 3D-printed supports, and 10x20mm dowels along the edges. They are finished with another plywood panel that runs towards the back of the pit on top. See second image.

# Screen mount

In front of the center console, a more
