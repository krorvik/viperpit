As a kid, I watched one of our old [CF-104 starfighters](http://www.starfighter.no/) pass by - with another, newer, aircraft following. Some 1000ft or maybe a bit more above the fjord, they both initiated a 180 degree turn. The newer of the two had turned around long before the starfighter was even at 90 degrees.

The new aircraft was one of the Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16As, likely a block 5 or 10. Growing up less than a km away from [Vigra Airport](https://avinor.no/en/airport/alesund-airport/) AES, or ENAL, my interest for winged machines was not a strange coincident. Runway 25 started just a few meters from the road where i cycled to school, and Braathens Fokker 27 and 28s, Boeing 737 200s, and many others were watched closely by happy kid eyes at every opportunity.

Somewhere around 6th grade, possibly a bit earlier, some 6 or so vipers were forward deployed to Vigra about a week, and we could watch them closely as they danced around the sky.

The [Royal Norwegian Air Force](https://www.forsvaret.no/en/organisation/air-force) is small, and as it's only fighter jet until this year, when the [F-35](https://www.f35.com/f35/global-enterprise/norway.html) takes over, my admiration for the F-16 was only natural. Upgraded through the years, the F-16A/BM (M for MLU - Mid Life Upgrade) as it is now called is as beautiful as the block 5, and just about as capable as the modern US blocks.

Piloting a fighter jet is something few humans get to experience, and for my part, my life took me down the lanes of electronics and computers. And in this world, there are simulations. So, that was where I spent my free time. That, and building [scale models](/viperpit/images/scale.jpg).

One of the first simulations that caught my attention was Falcon 2, and if I remember it right, I played it a lot on the Amiga 500. Great fun. But of course, at this time, computing power was quite limited, and the realism you could attain was limited at best. Not to speak of graphics quality, or screen sizes.

For those of us that admire the mighty Viper, there is a hole in time where there are few choices to virtually pilot such a thing of beauty. So my interest in flight simulations - and even airplanes - was dormant for a long time. This is where the rest of life was built. Education, working, a family. And computing power.

# Modern simulators

Fast forward a few years, past 32 bit x86, pentium and 64 bit CPUs, and we're at the simulator Falcon 4.0, and the [BMS variant](https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/content.php). The internet has taken over the world. Computers are powerful, and there is a rather good variety of commercial off the shelf controllers - by companies like Thrustmaster. Their hotas/cougar F-16 stick gave a very nice rendition of the Viper controls.

BMS is to me a very good simulator, and very specific to the F-16. It is getting a bit old though, and setup has been a little painful at times.

There are several Viper simulator pits based on Falcon BMS. Some even do custom force feedback bases for the stick. The F-16 was revolutionary on many counts, one being the sidestick controller that does not move much. Instead, the *force* applied by the pilot tells the computer what was the desired amount of control input. The computer will then decide what to do with the control surfaces.

Falcon BMS remained the choice of F-16 simpit builders for a long time (and might still be), but in 2008 another simulator hit the market, called [DCS - Digital Combat simulator](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/index.php). It was a follow-up to a title called Lock on: Modern air combat. DCS is modular, and presents the user with a range of modules for aircraft, terrains and campaigns.

In october 2019, an [F-16C block 50 module for DCS](https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/products/planes/viper/) was released in early access. The ease of DCS install, combined with modern high quality graphics, suddenly made simulation very interesting indeed. With recent releases (2.7), DCS has become even more impressive. The module is still in early access, but is progressing nicely and becoming more complete. It has been partially overshadowed by it's F/A-18C module counterpart, but this seems to be resolving nicely now.

The hole in my simulated viper world was finally plugged.
